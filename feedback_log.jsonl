This patient requires immediate attention.\n\n1.  **Clinical Rationale**: An elderly patient presenting with acute chest pain, significant hypoxemia (SpO2 89%), tachycardia (HR 120), and fever points to a critical cardiopulmonary event such as Acute Coronary Syndrome, Pulmonary Embolism, or severe pneumonia/cardiac decompensation. The prolonged waiting time further elevates the urgency.\n2.  **Critical Factors**: The primary drivers are **SpO2 89%**, the **chief complaint of cardiac/chest pain** with a **pain score of 8/10**, and **tachycardia (HR 120)**. These collectively indicate acute organ dysfunction and severe distress.\n3.  **Immediate Actions**: Immediately move to a monitored bed. Apply supplemental oxygen, place on cardiac monitor. Obtain a stat 12-lead ECG. Establish IV access, draw urgent labs including cardiac biomarkers, CBC, and consider a portable chest X-ray. Physician assessment and targeted treatment initiation must occur without delay.", "clinician_decision": "HIGH RISK - Immediate attention", "clinician_notes": "Patient sent to resuscitation bay - confirmed MI", "agreement": true}
